Hello Genetic
=============

I wanted to learn how to use genetic algorithms, so I wrote this simple set of functions. To run it, do

    ruby hello_genetic.rb

in a Terminal window or in cmd.exe. Enter a string (consisting of only alphabetic characters and/or spaces) and press Enter. You will be shown the progress that the algorithm is making at regular intervals. To change the frequency of this display, open up the hello_genetic.rb file and edit the last line of the file from

    main(250)

to something more or less frequent. For example, if you feel 250 is too frequent, try changing it to

    main(500)
